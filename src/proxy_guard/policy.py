"""JSON-backed allowlist for Proxy Guard remedial control (default-deny).

**Responsibility**
  Parse a static policy file and answer: given attributed TCP owner rows, is automated
  proxy remediation **allowed** for this endpoint session?

**System placement**
  Sits **after** attribution (``port_mapper`` / ``attribution_engine``) and **before**
  execution (``control``): ingestion of owner dicts → **policy evaluation** → serving
  an allow/deny decision to the orchestration layer.

**Key invariants**
  - **Default deny**: empty attribution or no whitelist hit yields ``allowed=False`` unless
    ``allow_when_attribution_empty`` is explicitly enabled.
  - **Deterministic**: same policy + same ``owner_rows`` → same ``PolicyDecision``.
  - **No network / DB**: evaluation is in-memory; loading reads one JSON file once per call.

**Consumers**
  ``src.proxy_guard.control`` and related orchestration call ``evaluate`` before any
  state-changing proxy reset.

**Engineering Notes**
  - Substring rules are intentionally simple (no regex) to keep policies auditable and
    predictable; trade-off is weaker expressiveness vs. operational clarity.
  - Exact matches are evaluated before substrings so administrators can carve out
    exceptions without substring shadowing surprises.

**Audit Notes**
  - Misconfiguration risk: overly broad substrings (e.g. ``"e"``) effectively allow
    everything—detect via policy review and integration tests.
  - Silent skipping: rows with missing/non-string ``process_name`` are ignored; detect by
    comparing attribution row count to evaluated row count in logs.

        flag name; ``None`` when denied without a match.

    **Attributes**
      source_path: Absolute path to the policy file (audit trail).
      allowed_process_name_substrings: Case-insensitive substring checks against each
        owner ``process_name`` (e.g. ``chrome`` matches ``chrome.exe``).
      allowed_process_names_exact: Case-insensitive **full** executable name match after
        lowercasing (e.g. ``clash-win.exe``).

      use only when empty attribution is a known benign state and logged elsewhere.

        **Decision intent**
          Prevent automated proxy remediation unless at least one attributed owner matches
          administrator-approved executable identifiers—balancing automation against mistaken
          disruption of unrelated processes.

        **Input assumptions**
          - ``owner_rows`` is ordered like upstream attribution (first row is primary).
          - Each row may include ``process_name`` (``str``) and ``pid``; other keys ignored.
          - Rows with missing, empty, or non-string ``process_name`` are **skipped** (not
            treated as deny by themselves; denial comes from no remaining matches).

        **Output guarantees**
          - Always returns ``PolicyDecision``; never raises for malformed row content.
          - If any row matches an exact rule, evaluation stops at first exact hit in row
            order; otherwise first substring hit wins.
          - ``primary_process_name`` reflects the first row’s ``process_name`` after
            lowercasing when that field is a non-empty string.

        **Constraints / limitations**
          - No PID validation, path checks, or signing—only executable **name** strings.
          - Substring rules cannot express exclusions (negation); narrow with exact rules.

        **Known failure modes**
          - Over-broad substrings allow unintended processes (policy review risk).
          - All rows skipped due to bad ``process_name`` → deny unless empty-list override.

        **Side effects**
          None (pure logic).

        **Idempotency**
          Repeated calls with identical ``owner_rows`` yield identical decisions; no

    """Load a Proxy Guard allowlist from JSON and return an immutable policy object.

    **Decision intent**
      Centralize schema validation so runtime evaluation never sees partially parsed or
      wrongly typed policy blobs.

    **Input data assumptions**
      - File is UTF-8 text containing a single JSON **object** at the root.
      - Optional keys (missing keys default to empty lists / ``False``):

        - ``allowed_process_name_substrings``: ``list[str]``
        - ``allowed_process_names_exact``: ``list[str]``
        - ``allow_when_attribution_empty``: ``bool``

    **Schema expectations**
      - Lists must contain only strings; unknown top-level keys are ignored.

    **Timezone / temporal data**
      None; policy files are static identifiers only.

    **Missing or bad data**
      - Malformed JSON → ``ValueError`` (wraps decode message).
      - Non-object root → ``ValueError``.
      - Wrong list element types → ``ValueError`` with field-specific message.

    **Side effects**
      Reads ``path`` from the local filesystem once; does not write.

    **Idempotency**
      Two loads of the same unchanged file produce equivalent ``ProxyGuardPolicy`` values;
      if the file changes between loads, results differ (not idempotent across mutation).

    **Performance**
      O(n) in total string entries; suitable for small operator-maintained policies.

    **Engineering Notes**
      ``path.resolve()`` stores a canonical path for audit logs; trade-off is absolute
      paths may differ on symlinked directories.

    **Audit Notes**
      - Corrupt JSON causes startup/load failure—detect in CI with schema tests.
      - Recovery: fix file on disk and reload (caller-dependent).
