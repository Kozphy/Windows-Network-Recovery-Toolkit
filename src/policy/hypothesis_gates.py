"""Map ranked hypotheses plus proof/trust signals to operator-facing remediation gates.

Purpose:
    Consume deterministic hypothesis scores (:mod:`src.hypothesis`), optional causal proof artefacts
    (:mod:`src.proof`), and trust aggregates (:mod:`src.observation`) to emit ALLOW / PREVIEW / BLOCK rows
    suitable for diagnose-live JSON payloads and audits.

Decision intent:
    ALLOW indicates safe-tier previews may proceed only after downstream confirmation—it never authorizes silent
    destructive remediation. Confidence bands gate unproven hypotheses; degraded trust caps ALLOW downward.

Inputs:
    Ordered ``(hypothesis_key, confidence, evidence_tuple)``, optional ``ProofResult``, proof enable flag,
    optional ``TrustAssessment`` for degraded-mode previews.

Outputs:
    JSON-serializable dict rows with hypotheses, rationale ``why`` strings, normalized ``risk_score`` fields.

Constraints:
    Confidence values are heuristic weights—not calibrated Bayesian posteriors. Proof scope today covers localhost
    proxy HTTPS contrasts for a fixed hypothesis subset; unrelated hypotheses remain UNPROVEN.

Known failure modes:
    Missing proofs leave ``proof_status=UNPROVEN``; contradictory trust signals force PREVIEW overrides even on
    CONFIRMED causal rows.

Verification / auditing:
    Diff ``hypothesis_decisions`` arrays against rerun ``replay`` output; inspect embedded ``why`` bullets for stale
    policy version mismatches.

Engineering Notes:
    Keeps string Enum policy decisions stable for dashboards and downstream allowlists relying on literals.

Boundary:
    Implements policy only—no subprocess or filesystem side effects inside this module.
