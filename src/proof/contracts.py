"""Shared immutable types for causal verification (Proof Engine).

Module responsibility:
    Provide ``ProofResult`` / ``ProofObservation`` envelopes produced by localhost-proxy HTTPS contrast checks
    and future observe-only probes that attach to diagnose-live artefacts.

Inputs / schemas:
    ``ProofResult`` serializes deterministically via ``to_dict`` for JSON embedding under ``proof_engine``.
    Observation ``outcome`` literals declare pass/fail/skip/error without implying OS-level remediation.

Timezone:
    Consumers stamp wall times elsewhere; structs here carry textual ``detail`` fields only—no clock assumptions.

Duplicates / malformed data:
    Hydration helpers (see ``src.audit.replay``) coerce unknown enums to conservative defaults rather than crashing
    parsers.

Safety / side effects:
    Implementations invoking these types may spawn subprocesses (curl, netsh/netstat/registry reads) documented in
    their modules but **never mutate** HKCU/HKLM firewall or routing tables from Proof Engine constructors defined here.

Audit Notes:
    Review ``ProofObservation`` sequence ordering when diagnosing inconclusive contrasts—skipped steps imply missing
    tooling or permissions rather than benign success.
