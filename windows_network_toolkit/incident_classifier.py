"""Incident classification from normalized analytics evidence events.

Module responsibility:
    Derive primary ``incident_class``, triage ``risk_level``, and policy recommendations from
    normalized ``EvidenceEvent`` bundles — without claiming malware or root cause.

System placement:
    Consumed by ``analytics_pipeline`` and indirectly by risk scoring and control test mapping.

Key invariants:
    * Every ``IncidentRecord`` includes ``limitations[]`` (standard + case-specific).
    * ``confidence`` is ordinal 0–1, not statistical probability.
    * Classification is not accusation — listener names are correlation only.

Decision intent:
    Triage endpoint proxy incidents for human review and control testing.

Audit Notes:
    * ``REVERTER_SUSPECTED`` requires timeline evidence — verify proxy-watch JSONL.
    * Recovery: collect additional probe_result events via ``proxy-health``.
