"""ETW ingestion boundary (prototype stub — no kernel session lifecycle).

Module responsibility:
    Define Protocol + in-memory implementations so callers can defer real Windows ETW wiring while
    still typing attribution pipelines uniformly.

System placement:
    Optional branch inside :mod:`evidence.attribution_engine`; absent rows keep attribution ``heuristic`` tier unless other telemetry compensates.

Key invariants:
    * ``StubETWReader`` never performs native calls—it only echoes injected batches suitable for pytest.
    * ``ETWProviderConfig`` retains metadata scaffolding only—GUID strings unvalidated against OS catalogs.

Concurrency:
    ``StubETWReader.drain_batches`` mutates queue—single-thread demos assume no concurrent drains.

Raises:
    None from stub reader; eventual real adapter should documentHRESULT failures explicitly.

Safety Notes:
    Future native ETW wrappers must elevate privileges thoughtfully—outside scope of stub.

Audit Notes:
    Persist raw ETW JSON only under operator-reviewed paths; stub currently prevents accidental egress by omission.
