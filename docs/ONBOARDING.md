# Onboarding — 10-minute repository map

**What this is:** A Technology Risk & Control Analytics toolkit for Windows endpoint proxy
reliability. It collects evidence, classifies incidents, runs control tests, scores risk,
previews remediation, and writes audit-ready reports.

**What this is not:** Antivirus, EDR/XDR, malware detection, or autonomous remediation.

**Documentation standards:** [code-documentation-standards.md](code-documentation-standards.md)

## Core flow (read top to bottom)

```text
Evidence → Classification → Control tests → Risk scoring → Human review → Audit → Report
```

| Stage | Primary module | CLI / API |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Evidence | `evidence_schema.py`, `proxy_state.py`, `proxy_health.py` | `proxy-status`, `proxy-health` |
| Classification | `incident_classifier.py` | (inside `analytics-summary`) |
| Control tests | `control_tests.py` | `control-test`, `GET /controls` |
| Risk scoring | `risk_scoring_engine.py` | `GET /risks` |
| Reporting | `reporting.py`, `analytics_pipeline.py` | `analytics-export`, `GET /reports/executive` |
| Latest snapshot | `latest_evidence_report.py` | `evidence-report --latest` |
| Remediation preview | `proxy_remediation.py` | `proxy-disable` (dry-run default) |

## Repository layout

```text
windows_network_toolkit/   # Primary CLI package (python -m windows_network_toolkit)
src/platform_core/         # Canonical governance, proof, audit, case-study risk
src/proxy_guard/           # Legacy proxy-watch integration
backend/                   # FastAPI host (optional local demo API)
frontend/                  # Optional Next.js dashboards
tests/                     # Pytest contracts and fixtures
docs/                      # Architecture, risk model, demo script
examples/reports/          # Sample executive export artefacts
```

## Safety boundaries (non-negotiable)

1. Observation is not proof.
2. Correlation is not causation.
3. Classification is not accusation.
4. Policy permission is not a safety guarantee.
5. Dry-run is default for registry-changing commands.
6. No silent process kill, firewall reset, or adapter disable.

See `windows_network_toolkit/safety.py` and `SECURITY.md`.

## CLI command map (high level)

Full argparse definitions live in `windows_network_toolkit/cli.py`.

| Group | Commands |
|-------|----------|
| Evidence | `proxy-status`, `proxy-health`, `proxy-watch`, `proxy-owner`, `diagnose`, `evidence-report` |
| Proof | `proxy-proof`, `tls-proof`, `proxy-writer-attribution` |
| Remediation | `proxy-disable` (dry-run default) |
| Analytics | `analytics-summary`, `analytics-export`, `powerbi-export` |
| Governance | `risk-assess`, `control-test`, `governance-report`, `risk-kpi-summary` |
| Audit | `audit verify` |

---

## First commands (fixture-safe, any OS)

```powershell
pip install -e ".[dev]"
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path

python -m windows_network_toolkit analytics-summary `
  --fixture tests/fixtures/analytics_pipeline_fixture.json --json

python -m windows_network_toolkit evidence-report --analytics `
  --fixture tests/fixtures/analytics_pipeline_fixture.json

python -m pytest -q
```

---

## API (optional)

```powershell
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `GET /trisk/health` | Technology risk API health |
| `GET /incidents` | Classified incidents |
| `GET /risks` | Risk scores |
| `GET /controls` | Control tests + catalog |
| `GET /reports/executive` | Executive JSON report |

Root `GET /health` serves the ERP platform router — not the technology risk API.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|--------|
| Empty analytics | Audit dir empty — use `--fixture` or run `proxy-watch` |
| HIGH risk but low proof | Expected with T0/T1 — read `limitations[]` |
| API 403 on fixture | Path must be under `tests/fixtures` or `examples` |
| Tests fail on Windows-only probes | Use fixture inject paths in CI |

---

## Audit notes for reviewers

- Verify hash-chained JSONL with `audit verify`.
- Compare API/CLI output schema versions before dashboard ingestion.
- Do not strip `limitations` from committee reports.
