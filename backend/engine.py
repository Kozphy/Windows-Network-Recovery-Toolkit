"""Deterministic diagnosis and anomaly scoring for SaaS API requests.

This module sits between request validation (`backend.main`) and persistence
(`backend.db`). It converts lightweight telemetry signals into
human-readable root-cause decisions with risk labels.

Key invariants:
    - Rule evaluation is deterministic for identical inputs.
    - No file/database/network side effects occur in this module.
    - Output shape is stable for API consumers and tests.

    Decision intent:
        Flag suspicious connection growth patterns that can indicate connection
        leaks or exhaustion trends.

    Input assumptions:
        - `recent_metrics` is newest-first.
        - Each metric row contains numeric `time_wait` and `established`.
        - Current values are non-negative integers.

    Output guarantees:
        - Always returns keys: `anomaly`, `reason`, and `signals`.
        - `signals` includes booleans for `rapid_growth`,
          `continuous_growth`, and `sudden_spike`.

    Side effects:
        None.

    Idempotency:
        Fully idempotent for identical inputs.

    Audit Notes:
        - What can go wrong: stale or sparse history can under-detect trends.
        - Detection: inspect `reason` and `signals` in diagnosis responses.
        - Recovery: gather additional samples and rerun diagnosis.

    Args:
        current_time_wait: Latest observed TIME_WAIT count.
        current_established: Latest observed ESTABLISHED count.
        recent_metrics: Recent persisted metrics (newest first).

    Returns:

    Decision intent:
        Provide an explainable next action for common Windows network failure
        patterns while preserving conservative risk defaults.

    Constraints and limitations:
        - Uses coarse-grained signals and simple precedence ordering.
        - Does not perform packet-level inspection or endpoint-specific tests.
        - Recommendations are advisory and require user/operator judgment.

    Known failure modes:
        - Multiple simultaneous issues may be collapsed into one top category.
        - Intermittent failures can produce unstable classifications across runs.

    Audit Notes:
        - What can go wrong: incorrect root-cause ordering under mixed signals.
        - Detection: compare returned recommendation with raw probe outputs.
        - Recovery: rerun probes, use monitor endpoint, and escalate to manual
          script-by-script validation.
