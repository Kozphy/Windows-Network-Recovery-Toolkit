"""Deterministic event/state reasoning engine for endpoint reliability.

Module responsibility:
    Orchestrate the deterministic Observation → Event → State Transition → Hypothesis →
    Reliability Impact → Policy chain. Produces a :class:`~platform_core.reasoning_models.ReasoningRun`
    with embedded evidence tree and policy decision. Never mutates Windows state and never
    spawns subprocesses; this module operates purely on caller-provided observations.

System placement:
    Used by ``platform_core.product_contract`` (diagnosis) and the ``platform_core.agent_planner``
    indirectly through stored diagnoses. Replay paths in :mod:`platform_core.reasoning_audit`
    feed observations back into :func:`run_reasoning` to recompute decisions without re-probing
    the host.

Key invariants:
    * The function set is **pure** with respect to the input ``Observation`` list. Same
      observations + same proof_result + same requested_action always produce the same
      :class:`PolicyDecision` outcome and reason codes.
    * ``DESTRUCTIVE_ACTION_TOKENS`` substring matches always BLOCK regardless of confidence
      or proof status.
    * Only action keys in :data:`SAFE_REGISTRY_ACTIONS` may ever reach an ``ALLOW`` outcome,
      and only with ``CONFIRMED`` proof + explicit confirmation + no conflicting signals.
    * High/critical impact without ``CONFIRMED`` proof is forced to ``PREVIEW`` even if the
      ALLOW gate above is widened in the future (see :func:`evaluate_reasoning_policy`).

Input assumptions:
    Caller supplies a list of :class:`Observation` rows. Signal names and value semantics
    must match those used by ``platform_core.failure_scenarios.normalize_signals``; unknown
    signal names are tolerated (ignored) but contribute nothing to scoring.

Output guarantees:
    :func:`run_reasoning` returns a :class:`ReasoningRun` that is JSON-serializable via the
    Pydantic/dataclass surfaces in ``reasoning_models``. ``confidence`` is an ordinal score
    in ``[0.0, 0.98]``, never a calibrated probability.

Side effects:
    None. Persistence and audit row writes are caller responsibilities.

Audit Notes:
    The reasoning engine is the **single authoritative policy gate** for the endpoint
    reliability platform. When operators dispute a decision:

    * Capture the input ``observations`` list and ``proof_result`` from the audit row.
    * Re-run :func:`run_reasoning` with the same arguments — output must match byte-for-byte
      because the engine is deterministic.
    * If outputs diverge, suspect a code change to scoring weights, scenario definitions, or
      policy thresholds; review git history for ``platform_core/reasoning_engine.py``,
      ``platform_core/failure_scenarios.py``, and ``platform_core/impact_score.py``.

Engineering Notes:
    The module deliberately avoids any I/O or subprocess to keep it replayable from JSONL
    and easy to test offline. Heuristic confidence is **rule-derived ordinal weight**, not a
    probability; widening it to a calibrated estimator would require fixture-driven
    calibration plus a documented contract change in ``platform_core.reasoning_models``.

    Decision intent:
        Decide whether the reasoning chain is strong enough to ALLOW a known-safe registry
        action, downgrade to PREVIEW for operator review, or BLOCK destructive paths. The
        function never executes remediation; it only emits the decision plus reason codes
        the audit log preserves.

    Args:
        hypothesis: Accepted hypothesis identifier (e.g. ``"browser_proxy_path_regression"``).
        transitions: Ordered :class:`StateTransition` list for this run; the last entry's
            ``to_state`` is reported as ``state_transition`` on the decision.
        proof_result: Outcome of the optional proof engine (status drives ALLOW eligibility).
        confidence: Ordinal hypothesis confidence in ``[0.0, 1.0]``; **not** a calibrated
            probability — used for explainability and audit trails only.
        impact_level: Reliability impact bucket (``"low"`` | ``"medium"`` | ``"high"`` |
            ``"critical"``); high/critical force PREVIEW unless proof is ``CONFIRMED``.
        requested_action: Optional remediation key. ``None`` returns a diagnostic-only
            ``PREVIEW`` decision. Substring matches in :data:`DESTRUCTIVE_ACTION_TOKENS`
            BLOCK unconditionally.
        explicit_confirmation: ``True`` when the operator typed the documented confirmation
            phrase via the CLI/API confirmation gate.
        conflicting_signals: ``True`` when normalized observations contain direct
            contradictions (e.g. ``browser_https_failed`` and ``browser_https_ok``).

    Returns:
        Immutable :class:`PolicyDecision` carrying ``outcome`` (``ALLOW`` | ``PREVIEW`` |
        ``BLOCK``), the resolved ``trust_level``/``evidence_level``, deduplicated
        ``reason_codes``, ``limitations``, and recommended next steps.

    Constraints and limitations:
        * Confidence alone never grants ALLOW — proof status and impact must align.
        * Unknown / unallowlisted action keys always BLOCK.
        * Tokens in :data:`DESTRUCTIVE_ACTION_TOKENS` BLOCK regardless of evidence.

    Audit Notes:
        This is the **single authoritative policy gate** for action evaluation. When an
        operator disputes ``outcome``:

        * What could go wrong: A widened ALLOW path could let a high-impact action through
          without proof. The defense-in-depth block (see ``# Defense-in-depth`` comment) is
          designed to catch this — every guardrail re-asserts ``outcome = "PREVIEW"`` rather
          than only annotating ``reason_codes``.
        * How to detect: ``reason_codes`` always carries the rule that fired; cross-check
          against ``outcome``. If ``outcome == "ALLOW"`` but a ``*_requires_*`` reason code
          is present, the gate has regressed.
        * How to recover: Re-run with the same inputs to verify determinism, then revert the
          offending change in this module or :mod:`platform_core.impact_score`.
        * Evidence available: Reason codes, limitations, and trust level are persisted on
          every reasoning run (``platform_data/audit.jsonl`` via callers).

    Pipeline stages:

        5. ``calculate_reliability_impact`` — derive severity/scope and the impact bucket.
        6. :func:`evaluate_reasoning_policy` — gate the requested action against policy.
        7. ``build_evidence_tree`` — assemble an explainable, replay-friendly tree.

    Args:
        observations: Replayable observations. **No machine probes happen here**; the engine
            is pure with respect to its inputs.
        proof_result: Optional :class:`ProofResult` from a targeted checker (e.g. HTTPS
            proxy bypass contrast). Defaults to ``ProofResult(NOT_RUN)`` shape.
        requested_action: Optional remediation action key. See :data:`SAFE_REGISTRY_ACTIONS`
            for the allowlist.
        explicit_confirmation: ``True`` when the operator typed the documented confirmation
            phrase. Required (along with ``CONFIRMED`` proof and no conflicts) for ``ALLOW``.
        source: Free-form caller label persisted on the reasoning run for audit lookup.
        run_id: Optional stable identifier for replay parity. Generated when omitted.

    Returns:
        :class:`ReasoningRun` with events, transitions, hypothesis ranking, evidence tree,
        proof result, reliability impact, policy decision, recommended next test, and an
        optional remediation preview (only populated when ``policy.outcome == "PREVIEW"``).

    Side effects:
        None. Persistence and audit row writes are caller responsibilities.

    Idempotency:
        Calling :func:`run_reasoning` twice with identical arguments yields equivalent
        :class:`ReasoningRun` objects (the only divergence is auto-generated ``run_id`` /
        nested IDs when the caller omits them).

        Use this function with the **stored observations** from
        ``platform_data/audit.jsonl`` to replay any historical decision without touching
        the host. Diverging output indicates a code change to scoring weights, scenario
        rules, impact buckets, or policy thresholds — review git history accordingly.
