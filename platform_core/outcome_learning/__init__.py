"""Outcome learning — evaluate recorded decisions against ground truth.

Pipeline::

    DecisionOutcome → OutcomeEvaluation → LearningMetrics → replay digest

Distinct from expected outcomes on decision snapshots
(:mod:`platform_core.decision_domain`). Used by the Decision Intelligence API
replay/metrics endpoints.
